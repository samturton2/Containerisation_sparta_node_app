# Docker with the Nodejs App

## Dockerfile
- Create an image with the latest nodejs docker container
```dockerfile
FROM node:latest
```
- Create the working directory in the container
```dockerfile
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
```
- Copy the app folder in this working directory to the container usr/src/ directory
```dockerfile
COPY app/ .
```
- run the npm install command
```dockerfile
RUN npm install
```
- Allow app to run on port 3000
```dockerfile
EXPOSE 3000
```
- Start the app
```dockerfile
CMD ["node", app.js"]
```

## Build image
- to build the image we ran 
```bash
docker build -t sturton/containerisation_sparta_node_app .
```
- This reads the docker file, and creates a container

- To run the container on port 80 we dont need a reverse proxy and can use the following command
- 
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:3000 sturton/containerisation_sparta_node_app
```
- This should show on the local host port

- The image can now be used using the `sturton/containerisation_sparta_node_app`
 
## Docker layer / multi stage build
```dockerfile
# Creating micro-services for nodejs front end
FROM node as APP

LABEL MAINTAINER=STurton@spartaglobal.com

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# path to working directory inside the container

#copy the required dependencies
copy ./app/ . 

FROM node:alpine
# building a multi stage layer

COPY --from=app /usr/src/app /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# run the npm install
RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

- this makes the same container 1/8th of the size

# Adding the DB
- to connect multiple containers together and launch as one we will need a docker-compose file.
- I have put both services in a network, for best practise if the microservice architecture were to be larger.
```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    container_name: nodeapp_container
    build:
      context: ./app/
      dockerfile: app.dockerfile
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db:27017 # This sets an environment variable for the db
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
    links:
      - db # Links the alias of the db container
    networks: 
      - nodeapp-network
  db:
    container_name: mongodb_for_nodeapp
    build:
      context: ./db/
      dockerfile: db.dockerfile
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks: 
      - nodeapp-network

networks:
  nodeapp-network:
    driver: bridge
```
- The docker-compose file is a yaml file ran with the command
```bash
docker-compose up
```
- The DB was declared in the [db.dockerfile](https://github.com/samturton2/Containerisation_sparta_node_app/blob/docker_layer/db/db.dockerfile)
```dockerfile
FROM mongo:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/db/

COPY ./mongod.conf /etc/

EXPOSE 27017

CMD ["mongod"]
```
- The container was ran with mongo's latest image. with port 27017 exposed.

- Once ```docker-compose up``` was ran we should see the app working on the fibonacci page URL `localhost/fibonacci/4`

- And the posts page working on the URL `localhost/posts`
